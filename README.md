# Malaysia House Price Prediction
Welcome to my Malaysia Housing Market Analysis project! In this Jupyter Notebook exploration, I delved into the dynamics of Malaysia's real estate landscape using Python. The dataset, sourced from 'mas_housing.csv,' underwent rigorous data preprocessing and transformation. Leveraging both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models, I predicted housing prices based on key factors such as property type, furnishing status, and location. The project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model fine-tuning, offering valuable insights into the intricate details of Malaysia's housing market.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed the dataset for effective modelling.
- **Modelling:** Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models for predicting housing prices.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Utilized visualization tools and metrics to assess and fine-tune model performance.
